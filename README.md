## Introduction

**gin--proc** is a GIN micro-service which allows the users to design efficient workflows for their work - by automating Snakemake, and build the workflows with open-source version of Continuous Integration (CI) service [Drone](https://drone.io/).

### Problem Statement

INCF is hosting a GIN service designed above GOGS with Git to serve as a repository management utility categorically for the Neuroinformatics data. The users (from non-tech backgrounds) find it tough to automate their workflows - precisely going from the input phase to the output phase. A lot of data makes writing workflows a repetitive and redundant task for them. Even if they are using tools like Snakemake. If they are past this stage, still testing all their workflows for potential errors and/or bugs for exorbitant amount of data and their workflows, consumes even more amount of time and reduces their efficiency.

<br>

### Rationale and Significance

This tool/micro-service is required since, given the GIN user base of neuroscientists and other pro-fessionals from the related fields, shouldn’t be involved in writing thousands of repeated workflows for their data, and then testing it manually. This tool will increase their efficiency by almost exponential levels by eradicating redundancy from their work.
